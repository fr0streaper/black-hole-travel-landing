# Black Hole Travel landing page

This is a landing page for a company providing black hole travel and transportation services. Obviously, it's a joke topic, which I chose just to justify putting a spinning image in the top bar. And I don't feel bad about it one bit :) This was created as a part of the web development course at ITMO University.
